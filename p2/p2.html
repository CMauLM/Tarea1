                <h2>How Big are black holes? </h2>
                <p>Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one
                    atom.
                    These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter,
                    or
                    "stuff," in an object.

                    Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of
                    the
                    sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called
                    the
                    Milky
                    Way.

                    The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes have masses that are more than
                    1
                    million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive
                    black
                    hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called
                    Sagittarius
                    A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could
                    hold a
                    few
                    million Earths.</p>
